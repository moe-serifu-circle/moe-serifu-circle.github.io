<h3 id="engineering-committee-creation">Engineering Committee Creation</h3>

<p>The proposed engineering committee is a committee responsible for the creation
of the primary product of the circle, Moe Serifu Agent, and is responsible for
engineering process and planning, including timeline estimation, subject to
oversight by the board of directors. It shall be headed by the position of
Technical Lead, who serves as both the manager of engineering efforts and
architecture as well as the chair of the committee, with the responsibility of
reporting on the committee&rsquo;s progress to the board of directors.</p>

<p>The motion passed. The engineering committee now exists, effective immediately,
and is subject to giving a progress report at each quarterly meeting.</p>

<h3 id="minor-engineer-participation">Minor Engineer Participation</h3>

<p>Rebecca brought up the fact that one of the volunteer engineers for the
newly-formed engineering team is currently a minor, and she mentioned her
concern that the nature of some of the work done by the circle might not be
appropriate for minors.</p>

<p>The board discussed this topic and came to the conclusion that due to the fact
that no works or products of an adult nature are currently being pursued by the
circle, that it would be appropriate for minors to volunteer with the
engineering team, with the stipulation that he could be neither a voting nor
non-voting member, and with the stipulation that if the circle were ever to
produce works of an adult nature, great care would be taken to segment out all
such discussion and works, and keep it inaccessible to minors to the full extent
that the law requires.</p>

<p>Rebecca motioned to allow the new member to join the Discord server and continue
participating in engineering efforts. Nate seconded. Voting is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebecca N: Aye</li>
<li>Jack H: Aye</li>
<li>Nathan S: Aye</li>
<li>Abby S: Aye</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-report">Technical Report</h3>

<p>As Tech Lead of the engineering team, Rebecca gave a report on the current state
of the Moe Serifu Agent project. As this was the first report, it was a little
longer than future ones will be. The complete report is available as a
presentation on the circle&rsquo;s Google Drive folder. The main points brought up are
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Engineering Resources

<ul>
<li>Currently there are 2 team members able to provide consistent effort
towards project completion: Jarod Pivovar, Engineer, and Rebecca Nelson,
Tech Lead.</li>
<li>An announcement of the new volunteer engineer, Jarod Pivovar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Project Timeline

<ul>
<li>April 26, 2019 is the target for the alpha release of MSA. The product is
slated to have graphical and audio output at that time, and thus will be
ready for alpha testing and early adopters.</li>
<li>December 6, 2019 is the target for the general availability release. The
product is slated to fully support at at least a rudimentary level all
proposed features, including multiple screens, 3D output, and voice
recognition.</li>
<li>Engineering sprints are set at 1 week. Every release consists of 8 weeks.
The planning meeting for each sprint takes place on Monday over a Discord
call.</li>
<li>A series of seven releases of the software was shown, as well as the focus
of each release.</li>
<li>Demos will be given during each quarterly board meeting&rsquo;s technical
report; the latest release completed at the time will be shown. In addition,
there will be a mid-release demo held by the engineers every 4 weeks; this
demo meeting is not mandatory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Publicity Planning

<ul>
<li>Short FB ad campaign that didn&rsquo;t work because there was no project yet.</li>
<li>Also have website, and occasional networking at anime events.</li>
<li>Main problem is that we don&rsquo;t yet have a product to show off to get people
excited about.</li>
<li>In order to have possible alpha testers and early-adopters lined up to try
our alpha release, we may want to consider advertising slightly before its
release target of April 26th, 2019.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
