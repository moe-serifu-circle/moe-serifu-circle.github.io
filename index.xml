      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of today, the Moe Serifu Agent project website has gone live! We are now up
and running at the oh-so-cute .moe TLD, and with our new URL we now have a place
to slap on project promotions. We&amp;rsquo;re now going be jumping right in to that as
we launch our first promotion campaigns. Just in time, too; we have our first
recruitment presentation tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>At this point, the first unit of work on the main website is complete. The primary design is finished, and now we only need to do a bit more work on the supplementary pages. The good news is that all of this can now be done without further work from high-powered graphics programs.
To be completely honest, this post is intended as a test for the upcoming blog pages and index.</description>
