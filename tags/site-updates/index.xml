      <description>The circle has officially begun to spin the wheels of progress! Just this week, Moe Serifu Circle held its first meeting of the Board of Directors. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great few months with people coming seemingly out of the woodwork to volunteer their services towards making Masa-chan a real application.
This first meeting had us discussing a variety of exciting topics for the near future of the circle. The long and short of it is that we are on a timeline to have all of our business paperwork in within the next month.</description>
